It's a big campus, covering over 823 acres (that's like, a lot of walking, folks!). The campus has a mix of modern and historic buildings, including the iconic Johnson Center, which is the heart of campus life. You'll find everything from restaurants and shops to a movie theater and a climbing wall. \n\nGMU also has a campus in Arlington, Virginia, which is right across the street from the Pentagon. And, get this, we're also home to the Antonin Scalia Law School in Arlington! That's a big deal, folks!\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"What about the campus vibes?\" Well, let's just say GMU has a pretty chill atmosphere. We've got a strong sense of community, with over 200 student organizations to get involved in. Plus, our students are an awesome bunch \u2013 smart, diverse, and always up for a good time.\n\nNow, I'm no expert, but I think that's a pretty good overview of our campus.
